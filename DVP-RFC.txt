2.  Conventions used in this document
INFO (REMOVE): Include this section only if needed. Suggested wording.
In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and server respectively.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be    interpreted as carrying significance described in RFC 2119.
In this document, the characters ">>" preceding an indented line(s)   indicates a statement using the key words listed above. This convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying or finding the portions of this RFC covered by these keywords.

6.  Formal Syntax
INFO (REMOVE): Include this section only if needed. Commonly used grammar is BNF grammar defined in RFC-2234.  Suggested wording.
The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [RFC2234].
<Define your formal syntax here.>
7.  Security Considerations
INFO (REMOVE): 	Every draft MUST have a Security Considerations section.
<Add any security considerations>
8.  IANA Considerations
INFO (REMOVE): 	Every draft MUST have an IANA Considerations section, although it may be removed prior to publication by the RFC Editor if null.
<Add any IANA considerations>
9.  Conclusions
<Add any conclusions>
10.  References
INFO (REMOVE): Authors can use either the auto-numbered references OR the named references; typically, these would not be mixed in a single document. This template includes both examples for illustration of the two variations. Named references are preferred (e.g., [RFC2119] or [Fab1999].
10.1.  Normative References
INFO (REMOVE): Normative refs are references to standards documents **required** to understand this doc. These are usually Standards-track and BCP RFCs, or external (IEEE, ANSI, etc.) standards, but may include other publications.

Appendix A. <First Appendix>
INFO (REMOVE): Starts on a new page. These are optional.
INFO (REMOVE): Careful with headers in appendices - they won't renumber when moved in/out levels in outline mode. Only Headers 1-9 do that trick, as used in the body of the RFC!
